This program provides a unique opportunity for students to work on real-world problems, enhancing their understanding of the industry and enriching their learning experience.


## Task 1: Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

This project is often referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. It's a great starting point for beginners to understand supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. The goal of this task is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width.

### About the Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". It has been widely used for machine learning testing and demonstrations.

It contains a set of 150 records under five attributes:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species

In this dataset, we analyze three species of Iris flower:

1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Versicolor
3. Iris Virginica

The dataset is small and can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

For more information about the Iris dataset, check out its Wikipedia page â€” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set.

## Model: Decision Tree

In this project, we use the Decision Tree model for classifying the Iris species. Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. They are ideal for this task because:

- They require relatively less effort for training the algorithm.
- They provide a clear indication of which fields are most important for prediction or classification.
